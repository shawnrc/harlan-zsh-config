# ZSH Config

This is my fork of harlanhaskins' awesome `harlan-zsh-config`. I just wanted to strip out the iOS-specific stuff and add my own aliases.

## Installation

If you trust me, here's a one-liner. Do not install this without reading the
script first. **Your configuration is backed up to `.zshrc.old`.**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shawnrc/harlan-zsh-config.git ~/.harlan-zsh-config; zsh ~/.harlan-zsh-config/setup-zshrc.zsh;
```
